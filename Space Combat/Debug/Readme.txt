Scenarios:

F1 - avoiding asteroids with steering trait inheritance

F2 - following a predefined path

F3 - dynamically generated grid allocation and A* performed on it. Gray cubes represent the boundaries of each grid node, lighter lines represent connections between them. Blue points are random points generated and addressed in the grid, thick red line is A* path.

F4 - following a more complicated predefined path

F5 - steering behaviours of wander, alignment, cohersion, separation, colision avoiding and more.

F6 - FSM, ship and asteroid docking, asteroid mining, etc.

F7 - Scenario to be submitted for Games AI portfolio, integration of FSM, A* and steering, all controls displayed during scenario

F8 - Demonstration of agents combat. One hive is using old AI for gathering resources, the second is focused only on fighting.

F9 - Full agent emotional FSM working, with two different roles - harvesters and fighters.

 

Controls:

Left Mouse Button and mouse movement - camera control
F1-F7 - select different scenarios
wsadqe - pitch, yaw and roll of camera
rf - zoom of camera
/ - cycling through grid display modes
+ - generating random asteroids to be addressed by the grid (scenario 3), making the agents angry (scenario 9)
- - generating a simple A* path (scenario 3), resetting agents' emotions (scenario 9)
* - generating a random A* path (scenario 3)
tgyhujikol - changing boid traits (scenario 5)
