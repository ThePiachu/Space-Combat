A pre-compiled version of the program is available in the Executable folder.


The controls for the system are:
/ – toggle display grid
ws ad qe – pitch, yaw and roll of camera
rf – camera zoom
mouse click and movement – camera control
Esc – quit
Tab – pause/unpause time flow
! – in some scenarios, it compiles the data about agents saved to the hard drive into one file
F1-F10 – start different scenarios


More controls are displayed in each appropriate scenario. Scenarios available are:

F1 – scenario focused on evaluating agent evolution in high density asteroid area
F2 – simple path following
F3 – grid and A-Star only scenario
F4 – more complicated path following
F5 – interactive scenario for flocking behaviours of wander, alignment, cohesion, separation and collision avoidance
F6 – scenario where the agents use simple FSM to mine asteroid and bring back resources
F7 – scenario where agents use simple FSM and A-Star algorithm for mining asteroids an bringing back the resources
F8 – agent combat
F9 – scenario involving two groups of agents – Harvesters and Fighters cooperating and competing for resources, with their actions being defined by virtual emotions of fear and anger and undergoing evolution
F10 – scenario involving two groups of agents – Harvesters and Fighters cooperating and competing for resources, with their actions being defined by virtual emotions of fear and anger and undergoing selective evolution
